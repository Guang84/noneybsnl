> ## ⚙️ About the Project
> This repository was created to provide a **stable online endpoint** for BSNL’s **NONEY broadband service**.
Since the **local server links frequently changed**, this GitHub-hosted version served as a **dynamic connector**—allowing customers and broadband systems to consistently access or redirect to the correct local server.

> #### The full application ran on a **local BSNL web server**, handling dynamic operations, user routing, and data exchanges.

> ✅ **Project Highlights:**
> * Fully implemented and operated successfully for a years.
> * Served as a reliable redirect and connection point between customers and the Noney BSNL broadband server.
> * Hosted via GitHub Pages for stability and testing  when local server updates & URLs changed.
